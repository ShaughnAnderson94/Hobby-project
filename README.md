# Hobby Page

by Shaughn Anderson


**Design Intent**: I wanted to make a page about nail art. The reqirements meant that I needed

1. a title
2. a clear structure
3. an image with alt text
4. visually interesing borderes and colors on the page
5. a list on the page
6. things fitting on screen
7. a link to another site
8. somewhere on the page where a correct date is displayed


I used the MDN recourses to buil this out. During it I learned a lot of the basics for HTML CSS and Java script. I am happy with the end results but would like to tune it a bit if there is time before the submission date.

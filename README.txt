Hobby Page

Shaughn Anderson


design intent: I wanted to make a page about nail art. The reqirements meant that needed

a title
a clear structure
an image with alt text
visually interesing borderes and colors on the page
a list on the page
things fitting on screen
a link to another site
somewhere on the page where a correct date is displayed


I used the MDN recourses to buil this out. During it I learned a lot of the basics for HTML CSS and Java script. I am happy with the end results but would like to tune it a bit if there is time before the submission date.
